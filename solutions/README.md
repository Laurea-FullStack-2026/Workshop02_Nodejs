# Solutions

This folder contains reference solutions for all workshop tasks.

## ⚠️ Important Notice for Students

**Do NOT look at these solutions until you've attempted the tasks yourself!**

Learning happens through struggle and problem-solving. Use these solutions only to:
- Verify your own solution after completing a task
- Understand alternative approaches
- Debug if you're completely stuck (but try asking for help first!)

## Solutions Overview

- **task1.js** - Hello Node.js (basic console output)
- **task2.js** - File System Operations (read, write, append)
- **task3.js** - Simple HTTP Server (routing and responses)
- **task4.js** - Command-Line Tool (process.argv handling)
- **task5.js** - Working with NPM Packages (using chalk)

## Testing Solutions

### Prerequisites
Make sure you're in the solutions directory and have Node.js installed.

For Task 5, you'll need to install dependencies:
```bash
npm install chalk@4.1.2
```

### Running Solutions

```bash
# Task 1
node task1.js

# Task 2
node task2.js

# Task 3
node task3.js
# Then visit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser

# Task 4
node task4.js greet Alice
node task4.js add 5 10
node task4.js info

# Task 5
node task5.js
```

## Notes

- These solutions follow best practices and include error handling
- Your solution might look different and still be correct
- There are often multiple valid ways to solve each task
- Code comments explain the key concepts

## Learning Tips

1. Try to solve tasks without looking at solutions
2. If stuck, review the requirement.md file first
3. Consult Node.js documentation
4. Ask instructors or peers before checking solutions
5. After solving, compare your approach with the reference solution
